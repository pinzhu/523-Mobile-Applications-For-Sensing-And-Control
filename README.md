## Course Description: ##
In this class we will learn how to develop modern applications for the Android mobile platform using Kotlinlanguage. This class will equip students with the practical skills necessary to develop modern mobileapplications able to take advantage of the myriad sensing and control capabilities that modern  smartphones offer.Students (individually and  in  teams) will  put  into  practicethe concepts learned in this course to develop a final project of their own choice, using an Android Smartphone and optionally an Arduino board.  This class will teach you how to write Android apps for sensing and control applications. 

## Learning Outcomes ##
Students will demonstrate the ability to:
• Apply Kotlin programming concepts to Android application development.
•Implement dynamic graphical user interfaces for Android mobile apps which combine different elements and actions.
•Extract data from different hardware sensors of an Android smartphone, and to process and interpret that datafor different applications.
•Program and control amicrocontroller-basedboard.
•Develop an Android App to wirelessly communicate with an microcontroller-basedboard, and tobe able to control different sensors.
